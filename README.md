The purpose of this Perl 5 / CPAN app is to generate
[SVGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) (=
a standardised XML-based vector graphics file format) containing a
graph/chart of numeric data from the command line. It accepts
[TSV (tab-separated values)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values)
as input, but support for different formats may be added in the future.

# THANKS

- Thanks to [Sawyer X](http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/) for telling me
why CPAN authors should write more command line applications.
- Thanks to the authors of [SVG::Graph](https://metacpan.org/release/SVG-Graph)
and [SVG::Graph::Kit](https://metacpan.org/release/SVG-Graph-Kit) which this
code makes use of.
